# excigma.glitch.me

[excigma.glitch.me](https://excigma.glitch.me) is an old website that I created after learning the basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. It was my first website that I created and I was pretty proud of it at that time - I recall spending too much time getting recaptcha to work.

In hindsight, the website is pretty bad. The code is messy and the design is ...quite poor.

Many thanks to [Glitch](https://glitch.com) for hosting this website and other things for free over the last few years. Glitch has allowed me to tinker with all sorts of projects.
